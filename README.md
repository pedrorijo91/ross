# ROSS - Rails Open Source Software 

Small sandbox project to experiment the Rails framework (and ruby in general).

Given a github username, it fetchs the OSS contributions on GitHub, and assigns a score
to the user profile - gamification style.

Currently it uses information from personal repositories (number of stars and forks). 
Ideally it should take into account organizations the user belongs to, and contributions
to other projects (both as PR, comments, issue creation/comments, etc). But as said before,
 it's just a sandbox project to explore Ruby/Rails features.

Some used features:

- Rails cache
- Initializers
- (View) helpers
